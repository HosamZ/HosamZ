//Reuse the Tool from exercise 3 (donâ€™t copy it, reuse the existing one from the package where it already is).
//A Toolbox has a color and a list of Tool. Its constructor only asks for the color.
// Make sure its tools are initialized with an empty collection. It also has the method add to add a Tool
// to its list and the method getTools that returns the list.
//A ShopAssistant has no attributes. It has the findToolbox method that receives a list of
// String representing the names of the tools the customer asks for and returns a Toolbox. In order to
// create a Toolbox it creates one article per tool requested adding them to the Toolbox then it returns it.
//In the ToolShopApplication class main method, create a list of String with three tool names
// inside, create a ShopAssistant and use it to find a red Toolbox with those three tools inside.
